## About Me

I am a passionate Python developer with a keen interest in data analysis and project management.
The `Spark` project reflects my dedication to leveraging Python for in-depth analysis of GitLab repositories.
From tracking issue velocity to visualizing project milestones, `Spark` is designed to provide actionable insights for effective project management and collaboration.
If you share a passion for Python development or project analytics, I invite you to explore Spark with me.
